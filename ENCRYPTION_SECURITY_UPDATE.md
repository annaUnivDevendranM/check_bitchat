# EncryptionService Security Update

**Author:** Unit 221B  
**Date:** January 8, 2025

## Overview

This document describes the security enhancements made to the `EncryptionService.swift` file to address the critical vulnerability where private cryptographic keys were stored in UserDefaults without proper protection.

## Security Vulnerability Fixed

### Previous Implementation
- Private keys were stored in UserDefaults (lines 43-50)
- No hardware security features utilized
- No biometric authentication required
- Keys accessible to any process with app sandbox access
- No key rotation mechanism

### Security Risks
1. **Unauthorized Access**: UserDefaults data can be accessed by any process running within the app's sandbox
2. **Backup Exposure**: UserDefaults data is included in device backups, potentially exposing keys
3. **No Hardware Protection**: Keys were not protected by the Secure Enclave or hardware encryption
4. **Static Keys**: No mechanism for key rotation, increasing risk over time

## Security Enhancements Implemented

### 1. iOS Keychain Integration
- All private keys now stored in iOS Keychain
- Keychain provides hardware-backed encryption
- Keys are never stored in plaintext

### 2. Hardware Security Features
- `kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly` ensures:
  - Keys only accessible when device is unlocked
  - Keys are not synchronized to iCloud
  - Keys are not included in device backups
  - Keys are bound to the specific device

### 3. Biometric Authentication
- `.biometryCurrentSet` flag requires Face ID or Touch ID
- Keys are invalidated if biometric data changes
- Provides strong user authentication for key access

### 4. Key Rotation Mechanism
- Automatic key rotation every 30 days
- Rotation timestamp tracked securely
- Foundation for future key lifecycle management

### 5. Comprehensive Error Handling
- Detailed error types for all keychain operations
- Proper error propagation throughout the system
- Graceful handling of authentication failures

## Implementation Details

### Key Storage Structure
```swift
private let keychainService = "com.bitchat.encryption"
private let identityKeyTag = "com.bitchat.identityKey"
private let keyRotationTag = "com.bitchat.keyRotation"
```

### Access Control Configuration
```swift
SecAccessControlCreateWithFlags(
    kCFAllocatorDefault,
    kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlockedThisDeviceOnly,
    [.biometryCurrentSet, .privateKeyUsage],
    &error
)
```

### Error Handling
New error cases added to handle keychain operations:
- `keychainError(Error)`
- `keychainSaveError(OSStatus)`
- `keychainLoadError(OSStatus)`
- `keychainDeleteError(OSStatus)`
- `keychainAccessControlCreationFailed`
- `keychainDataCorrupted`
- `biometricAuthenticationFailed`
- `biometricAuthenticationCanceled`

## Migration Impact

### Code Changes Required
1. `EncryptionService` initialization is now throwing
2. `clearPersistentIdentity()` is now throwing
3. Error handling added to `BluetoothMeshService`

### User Experience Impact
- First launch will prompt for biometric authentication
- Biometric prompt appears when accessing encrypted identity
- Enhanced security without degrading user experience

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Device Testing**: Test on physical devices with Face ID/Touch ID
2. **Error Scenarios**: Test biometric failure/cancellation
3. **Key Rotation**: Verify key rotation after 30 days
4. **Panic Mode**: Ensure emergency disconnect properly clears keys
5. **Migration**: Test upgrade from previous version

## Future Enhancements

1. **Key Escrow**: Implement secure key backup mechanism
2. **Multi-Device Support**: Secure key synchronization protocol
3. **Advanced Rotation**: Per-peer key rotation schedules
4. **Audit Logging**: Track all key access attempts

## Security Best Practices

1. Never log or print key material
2. Clear sensitive data from memory after use
3. Use constant-time comparisons for cryptographic operations
4. Regular security audits of key management code
5. Monitor for keychain access anomalies

## Compliance

This implementation aligns with:
- iOS Security Best Practices
- NIST Key Management Guidelines
- Common Criteria for Mobile Device Security
- OWASP Mobile Security Standards
